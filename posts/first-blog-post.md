Hello, world!

This is our pictures about the game!

this a relly tall tower

At first we thought it was some powerful machine, but it turned out to be just a vending machine.

We have tried our best to find this book

A very interesting statue, like a work of art

I'm not sure if this gate belongs to our school anymore.

What a unique trademark!

In this video, there is a lot of traffic in front of the school. The tram stops and people get on and off. Because during a time after get off work and school, I see people rushing to go home, or some people are also rushing to a relaxing party after a hard day.

this is the simple storyboard about my first video
![storyboard](/w01s2/storyboard.jpg)
As you can see, my story is about the life of an international student who has just arrived in Australia. 
He didn't adapt to life here at first, couldn't find friends, and he missed home.
In this story, I will use a gradual introduction to express the continuity of the story, which includes the gradual introduction of sadness, the gradual introduction of pictures, and the gradual introduction of music.
I will usually use cross dissolve and short cut in editing.
This story wants to express a sad emotion

Because I want to express a sad emotion, the background music used in my video will be slow and lyrical in major keys.
In terms of sound effects, I selected some sound effects that enhance the effects of the video materials based on my video materials, such as the sound of turning pages, the sound of leaves, etc.

I took a lot of pictures of the scenery when I was shooting the material, but I found that the scenery alone could not fully express the sad emotion, so I also took pictures of people doing homework alone and not daring to speak in class.

Video description: This is a video about the life of a student who has just arrived abroad, with some sadness.

Week 4 I leant the elements about the icon. In this project, I think the theme of "future" suits me very well. I can think of many elements about the future. This is very similar to technology. In the future, technology will generally be more developed, such as rockets, robots, virtual reality, smart phones, watches, or human implants.

There are also many game icons that are very futuristic, so I want to design a series of game icons with future themes for the many young people who like games.

![draft](/w01s2/draft.jpg)
Last time I was going to make a game icon, but I found that the theme of the future was too limited to be used as a game icon, so I decided to make something similar to a commercial icon. See my draft above. The first thing that came to my mind was virtual reality. I remembered that an anime work I had seen before had a device called augmented reality, so I drew it. There are also human implants. After I had this idea, I planned to make a sequential human brain implant, from a normal brain to a chip-modified brain. In addition, there are smart watches, rockets, and astronauts. When I was drawing the astronauts, I thought about doing something different, replacing the astronauts' spacesuits with different tools or lighter spacesuits. I also thought of the atomic nucleus. Nuclear energy is also a technology that future science and technology hopes to master. I think it fits this future project very well. And so on are my thoughts.
